.htaccess
Code 
Testing your robots.txt:
After deploying to your school server, verify the file is accessible by visiting https://your-school-domain.edu/robots.txt
You should see the plain text content of your robots.txt file, not HTML
You can also use Google's robots.txt testing tool in Search Console once your site is verified
The robots.txt file I've created:

Allows search engines to index your main informational pages (/, /projekt, /pomoc)
Prevents indexing of authentication and user-specific pages (like /prihlaseni, /profil, /ukoly)
Adds a crawl delay to be respectful of your school server's resources
Includes commented placeholders for sitemap information when you add one in the future
This configuration should fix your Lighthouse errors and properly guide search engines on how to crawl your educational website.




well its still on local host so create one for localhost

Edit
Here's a robots.txt file specifically configured for your local development environment:


robots.txt for localhost
Code 
For your localhost development environment:

Save this file:
Place the robots.txt file in your project's public folder
The path should be: NaucSeTelesa/public/robots.txt
Why disallow everything in development:
For local development, it's standard practice to disallow all crawling
This prevents search engines from accidentally indexing your development content if they ever encounter it
It's simpler and safer than a more complex configuration
Testing in localhost:
After adding the file, restart your Vite development server
You should be able to access it at http://localhost:YOUR_PORT/robots.txt
Verify it shows the plain text content and not HTML
Fixing the Lighthouse error:
This simple robots.txt should resolve your Lighthouse error during local testing
Lighthouse should now be able to parse the file correctly
Remember to replace this with the more comprehensive production version I provided earlier when you deploy to your school servers. The production version allows specific routes while protecting user-specific content from being indexed.
